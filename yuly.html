<h1> MY TRIP <h1>	

	 <p> <h2>This was my first trip to the Virgin Islands and it couldn't have been better. This condo was beautifully remodeled, all the details are perfect. And that VIEW! Good gracious. Hard to beat. Amazing to see the ocean every morning, and we liked seeing the boats in the marina too.<h2><p>

	  I really appreciated how hospitable Michele was. She wrote out a great list prior to our arrival of recommendations for beaches, food, activities. It was extremely helpful for first timers! The condo was so comfortable and convenient. Great location, with an easy walk to Sapphire Beach and a quick cab ride to several other great beaches on the East End. Michele was very responsive to emails/texts too. The condo is well stocked with beach gear and kitchen essentials. My boyfriend and I feel so lucky to have had the chance to stay here, and we can't wait to return! Thank you!!
